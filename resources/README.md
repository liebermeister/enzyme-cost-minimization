Data Resources for Enzyme Cost Minimization
-------------------------------------------

Subdirectories:

data-files - Quantitative data in SBtab table format (see www.sbtab.org)
           (metabolite levels, fluxes, kinetic constants etc.)

model-files - Example models
           includes "pathways"
	     - Stoichiometric descriptions of metabolic pathways
               in a format similar to KEGG's
               A single file can contain multiple pathways
