==========================================

Wolfram Liebermeister (2015)

Dependencies: 
For some of the MATLAB functions, the following MATLAB toolboxes must be installed

  o Matlab utility functions    (https://github.com/liebermeister/matlab-utils)

  o Metabolic Network Toolbox (https://github.com/liebermeister/mnt)

  o SBMLtoolbox               (http://sbml.org/Software/SBMLToolbox)

  o SBtab toolbox             (https://github.com/liebermeister/sbtab-matlab)

  o DERIVESTsuite             (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/13490-adaptive-robust-numerical-differentiation)

Please make sure that these matlab packages are installed in your system and that all these directories and subdirectories are included in your matlab path.

Please note that the following packages are required by some functions in the Metabolic Networks Toolbox, but they are not required for Enzyme Cost Minimization

  o Tensor toolbox (http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html)

  o efmtool        (http://www.csb.ethz.ch/tools/efmtool)
